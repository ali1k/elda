<h1>Elda &mdash; an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<p>
	Elda is a Java implementation of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/" rel="nofollow">Linked Data API</a>. 
	Version 1.2.27 (<a href="ReleaseNotes/latest.text" rel="nofollow">ReleaseNotes/latest.text</a>) 
	was released on 5 December 2013. Maven artifacts are available from 
	<a href="http://repository.epimorphics.com" rel="nofollow">http://repository.epimorphics.com</a>
	(groupid com.epimorphics.lda, artifactId and name lda, version 1.2.27). 
</p>

<p>
	The Linked Data API provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple 
	RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint. The API developer 
	(probably you) writes an API spec (in RDF) which specifies how to translate URLs into queries.  
</p>

<p>
	Elda is the Epimorphics implementation of the LDA. It comes with some pre-built  examples 
	which allow you to experiment with the style of query and get started with building your own configurations. 
	For documentation on downloading and installing Elda, see the  
	<a href="docs/E1.2.27/index.html" rel="nofollow">the quickstart documentation</a>; 
	you can also <a href="docs/E1.2.28/index.html" rel="nofollow">preview documentation from upcoming versions of Elda </a>. 
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.27 does cycle-detection for the XML (and HTML and CSV) renderers using  a linear algorithm so that 
	heavily entangled graphs don&#x27;t take forever to render. Also the webapp-relative control/clear-cache URL 
	can (and should) be POSTed to rather than GETted from. </p>
	
<p>
	Elda 1.2.26 had improved documentation, including separate sections for the use of the Velocity renderer 
	and configuration and URI use cribsheet. The text search feature was completed and the example Velocity 
	templates much expanded.
