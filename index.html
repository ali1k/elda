<h1>Elda, an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<p>
	Elda is a Java implementation of the 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/" rel="nofollow">Linked Data API</a>,
	which provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple 
	RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint. 
	The API developer (probably you) writes an API spec (in RDF) which 
	specifies how to translate URLs into queries. 
</p>

<p>
	Elda is the Epimorphics implementation of the LDA. It comes with some pre-built  examples 
	which allow you to experiment with the style of query and get started with building your own configurations. 
	For documentation on downloading and installing Elda, see the  
	<a href="docs/E1.2.30/index.html" rel="nofollow">the quickstart documentation</a>; 
	you can also <a href="docs/E1.2.31/index.html" rel="nofollow">preview documentation from upcoming versions of Elda </a>.
	The current standalone jar is accessible via Maven or you can just download
	<a href="http://repository.epimorphics.com/com/epimorphics/lda/elda-standalone/1.2.30/elda-standalone-1.2.30.jar">
	http://repository.epimorphics.com/com/epimorphics/lda/elda-standalone/1.2.30/elda-standalone-1.2.30.jar
	</a>
</p>
	
<p>
	Elda 1.2.30 (<a href="ReleaseNotes/latest.text" rel="nofollow">ReleaseNotes/latest.text</a>) 
	was released on 20th March 2014. Maven artifacts are available from 
	<a href="http://repository.epimorphics.com" rel="nofollow">http://repository.epimorphics.com</a>
	(groupid com.epimorphics.lda, artifactId and name lda, version 1.2.30). 
	Elda now allows cache expiry times to be attached to properties,
	endpoints, and APIs, generates <b>Expires:</b> headers appropriately,
	and respects those expiry times in its internal caches.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.29 enables item counting for list endpoints, where the total number of items
	that would be viewable through the page-sized windows is made available as page
	metadata (os:totalResults). By default this is off, but it can be configured on 
	and made optional in the URL.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.28 is a copy of 1.2.27 but moved from Googlecode to Github.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.27 does cycle-detection for the XML (and HTML and CSV) renderers using  a linear algorithm so that 
	heavily entangled graphs don&#x27;t take forever to render. Also the webapp-relative control/clear-cache URL 
	can (and should) be POSTed to rather than GETted from. </p>
	
<p>
	Elda 1.2.26 had improved documentation, including separate sections for the use of the Velocity renderer 
	and configuration and URI use cribsheet. The text search feature was completed and the example Velocity 
	templates much expanded.
