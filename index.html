<h1>Elda, an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<p>
	Elda is a Java implementation of the 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/" rel="nofollow">Linked Data API</a>,
	which provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple 
	RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint. 
	The API developer (probably you) writes an API spec (in RDF) which 
	specifies how to translate URLs into queries. 
</p>

<p>
	Elda is the Epimorphics implementation of the LDA. It comes with some pre-built  examples 
	which allow you to experiment with the style of query and get started with building your own configurations. 
	For documentation on downloading and installing Elda, see the  
	<a href="docs/E1.2.34/index.html" rel="nofollow">the quickstart documentation</a>; 
	you can also <a href="docs/E1.2.34/index.html" rel="nofollow">preview documentation from upcoming versions of Elda </a>.
	The current standalone jar is accessible via Maven or you can just download
	<a href="http://repository.epimorphics.com/com/epimorphics/lda/elda-standalone/1.2.34/elda-standalone-1.2.34.jar">
	http://repository.epimorphics.com/com/epimorphics/lda/elda-standalone/1.2.34/elda-standalone-1.2.34.jar
	</a>
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.34 was released on 8th July 2014
	(groupid com.epimorphics.lda, artifactId and name lda, version 1.2.33). 
	The default XSLT processer has been changed to Saxon 9.5.1-5. The mapping
	from strings to resource names for XSLT tenplates and the Velocity root has
	been made the same and is more precisely defined. It is now possible to
	specify on an endpoint or in a request URI the name of a non-default graph
	in the SPARQL endpoint's dataset.
	See <a href="ReleaseNotes/latest.text" rel="nofollow">ReleaseNotes/latest.text</a>
	for more details.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.33 was released on 23rd April 2014 (groupid com.epimorphics.lda, artifactId and name lda, version 1.2.33).
	It corrects a problem with item endpoints which failed to find the requested item but did
	not generate a 404 response status. (Version .32 was an intermediate release that incompletely
	resolved this issue.)
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.31 (<a href="ReleaseNotes/latest.text" rel="nofollow">ReleaseNotes/latest.text</a>) 
	was released on 24th March 2014.
	Elda now allows cache expiry times to be attached to properties,
	endpoints, and APIs, generates <b>Expires:</b> headers appropriately,
	and respects those expiry times in its internal caches.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.30, released on 20th March 2014, contains a serious item-counting/cache
       	error and should not be used; it is replaced by Elda 1.2.32.
</p>

<p>
	Elda 1.2.29 enables item counting for list endpoints, where the total number of items
	that would be viewable through the page-sized windows is made available as page
	metadata (os:totalResults). By default this is off, but it can be configured on 
	and made optional in the URL.
