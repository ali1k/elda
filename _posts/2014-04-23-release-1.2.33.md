Elda 1.2.33 was released on 23rd April 2014 (groupid
`com.epimorphics.lda`, artifactId and name `lda`, version 1.2.33). It
corrects a problem with item endpoints which failed to find the
requested item but did not generate a 404 response status. (Version .32
was an intermediate release that incompletely resolved this issue.)
