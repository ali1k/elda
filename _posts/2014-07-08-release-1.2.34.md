Elda 1.2.34 was released on 8th July 2014 (groupid `com.epimorphics.lda`,
artifactId and name `lda`, version 1.2.33). The default XSLT processer has
been changed to Saxon 9.5.1-5. The mapping from strings to resource
names for XSLT tenplates and the Velocity root has been made the same
and is more precisely defined. It is now possible to specify on an
endpoint or in a request URI the name of a non-default graph in the
SPARQL endpoint's dataset. See
[ReleaseNotes/latest.text](ReleaseNotes/latest.text) for more details.
